TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 14)
=====================================

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done
    - X  stories committed, Y stories done 
- Total points committed vs. done
    - X points committed, Y points done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
    - X hours estimated, Y hours spent

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| _#0_  |         | -      |            |              |

   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
    - estimate average: X hours | estimate standard deviation: Y
    - actual average: X hours | actual standard deviation: Y  
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
    - error ratio: X

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
