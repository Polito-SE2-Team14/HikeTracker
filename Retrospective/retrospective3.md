## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done
    - 10 stories committed, 10 stories done 
- Total points committed vs. done
    - 54 points committed, 54 points done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
    -  hours estimated,  hours spent

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
      
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - less go babyyy
