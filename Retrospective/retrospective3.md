> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
    - estimate average:  hours | estimate standard deviation: 
    - actual average:  hours | actual standard deviation: 
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
    - error ratio: 


## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
      
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
