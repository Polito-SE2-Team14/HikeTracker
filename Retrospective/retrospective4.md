## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done
    - 3 stories committed, 3 stories done 
- Total points committed vs. done
    - 21 points committed, 21 points done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
    -  hours estimated,  hours spent

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed


### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| :---: | :-----: | :----: | :--------: | :----------: |
| _#0_  |   15    |   -    |            |              |
| _#17_ |    7    |   8    |            |              |
| _#18_ |    6    |   8    |            |              |
| _#34_ |    6    |   5    |            |              |




- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
    - estimate average:  hours | estimate standard deviation:   hours 
    - actual average:  hours | actual standard deviation:  hours
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
    - error ratio: 


## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 96 unit + 149 api = 245
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube: 
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues: 
  - Hours spent on remediation: 
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"): 
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )  
    - Reliability: A
    - Security: A
    - Mantainability: A


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Our estimation was quite accurate

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - A good initial setup allowed us to work better and implement more features

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - We coordinated better and we interacted with each other more frequently
      
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - We met every goal set in the previous sprint

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Keep the same pace we had in this sprint

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - We are proud of the improvement of the coordination between us sprint by sprint
