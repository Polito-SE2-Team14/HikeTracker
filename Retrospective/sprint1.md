TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 14)
=====================================

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done
    - 3 stories committed, 2 stories done 
- Total points committed vs. done
    - 16 points committed, 8 points done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
    - 60 hours estimated, 61 hours and 30 minutes spent

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    8    |    -   |    35      |     31,5     |

| #3     |    3    |    3   |     6      |      7       |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
    - estimate average: 2.72 hours | estimate standard deviation: 1.97
    - actual average:  2.79 hours | actual standard deviation: 2.22   
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
    - error ratio: -0.024

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Learning to use new frameworks (leaflet, jest, mocha) took more time than expected

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - Assign more time to E2E testing and better description for tasks

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - We made better estimation and also included testing and code review in the sprint plan
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - Coordination is still to be improved but progress has been made

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Better task assignment to reduce integration time between client-side and server-side components
  - Better description of task, with clarity on which job is part of the task
  - More focus on the responsiveness of the web-app GUI
  - Using a combination of different test frameworks
  - More frequent meetings between team members 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - Commitment of all team members to the project
