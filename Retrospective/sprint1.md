## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done
    - 3 stories committed, 2 stories done 
- Total points committed vs. done
    - 16 points committed, 8 points done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
    - 60 hours estimated, 61 hours and 30 minutes spent

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    8    |    -   |    35      |     31,5     |

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
    - estimate average: 2.72 hours | estimate standard deviation: 
    - actual average:  2.79 hours | actual standard deviation:    
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
