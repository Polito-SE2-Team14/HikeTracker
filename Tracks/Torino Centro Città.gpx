    <desc><![CDATA[Starting point of the tour, the square is named after Statuto Albertino, the Statute Chart released by King Charles Albert in 1848. Not only this document was adopted when Italy was later unified in 1861, but survived until 1946 when the new Constitution of Italy was introduced.
The monument in the middle of the square was erected to commemorate the Frejus railroad tunnel connecting with France, the rocks forming the pyramid were actually excavated from such tunnel. On its eastern side, the square opens onto Via Garibaldi.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Porta Palatina]]></name>
    <desc><![CDATA[A couple of decades B.C. Torino acquired the status of Roman City with the name of Augusta Taurinorum. The Roman city layout was the usual gridlock with evenly-spaced streets intersecting at square angles. The squared off, walled city had an access gate located in the middle of each side and one of these, which was the Northern Gate, still stands today with the name of Porte Palatine. The brick building has two towers which served a number of scopes through the centuries, even as a prison.
The largest street market in town, nearby Porta Palazzo, obviously took its name from this Roman feature.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Duomo]]></name>
    <desc><![CDATA[The linen commonly defined as the "Holy Shroud of Turin" is kept in this cathedral and is undoubtedly interesting aside of the debate around it.
Some believe it's the cloth that wrapped the body of Jesus Christ, some claim it's absolutely not. Studies conducted though various technologies have proved the Shroud to be dating back to the 12th century and concluding that the full body image, front and back, was left on the linen by the corpse of a crucified man.
Regardless of the age or the origin of this cloth, it's a rare and impressive testimony of the cruel practice of terminating somebody by crucifixion and a horrible public death to be suffered.
A copy of the linen is displayed inside the Duomo church at all times, while the original is only displayed once every several years and seen by hundreds of thousands of visitors.
Near the church south side, a pedestrian passage leads to the front yard of the imposing Palazzo Reale.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Piazza Castello (Castle Square) is the heart of the city and the perfect location for a journey through the ages. Its center is dominated by the imposing medieval castle that retains two of its original typical corner towers. It was built on top of the Roman Western Gate and fortification walls, remnants of which are still visible at ground level. The west side of the Castle was later rebuilt into a magnificent baroque facade and building, serving as the seat of the first Italian Senate and named Palazzo Madama. "Madama" means "lady" in Turinese dialect - which is similar to French language - and since used as as the building's nickname because it was the residence of Maria Cristina of France.
Palazzo Madama recently underwent restoration works that lasted for 20 years. Should one not have the time to visit one of the 43 museums in town, do at least access this building.

You can choose whether to visit the National Museum of Cinema and/or take the elevator for a few Euro fee. This elevator takes up to the observation deck and it's not recommended to those who are afraid of height. The car runs on cables right in the center axis of the building with empty space around and a few friends felt extremely uncomfortable.
The observation deck offers a magnificent 270º view over the Alps. Just avoid hazy days.]]></desc>

King Vittorio Emanuele II was born here, as the huge cast bronze plaque reports, and the building was the seat of the Parliament starting in 1848. With the unification of Italy in 1861, it then became the seat of the first Italian Parliament. Actually too small to host the increase number of the members, sessions were temporarily held in the courtyard. Walk inside to find it, and note the different - newer - bricks that were used to expand the bulding.

    <desc><![CDATA[The first archeological expeditions sponsored by the House of Savoy prompted the dedication of an area inside the university building, the "Accademia delle Scienze", where artifacts were collected and stored. Most of these were acquired from the French consul in Cairo. Later transformed into the Egyptian Museum, the extraordinary importance of the structure is today only second to that of Cairo, Egypt.
The museum has recently been upgraded to a more visitor-friendly scale and it's very rich. There's even a complete original tomb, parts of which were donated and relocated by the Egyptian government as a recognition to the important discoveries and studies carried out by Schiaparelli in early 1900.
Mummies are the main obvious objects to drag visitors, although the impressive statues section is arranged in two rooms where lights and sound effects create an impressive ambience.]]></desc>

The large square space recently underwent heavy excavations to build underground parking space, but every cobblestone and stone slab went back to the original place. After such upgrade the square was banned to motor traffic and finally turned into a space to enjoy, especially on the occasion of public stage events.

San Carlo Borromeo and Santa Cristina, both built in the first half of 1600 with their baroque facades overlooking Piazza San Carlo. Piazza CLN still carries the portico continuity although it shows an architecture leap of 300 years.

    <desc><![CDATA[Definitely a highlight, Stupinigi is too far to be included in this walking tour.
This stunning palace was one of the hunting lodges built for the leisure of the House of Savoy, and part of the network of residences scattered around Torino. Other than the Royal rooms, gardens and woods, the complex also included farms and warehouses still existing today despite their scope had changed through the years.
The somptuous entrance behind an elaborate iron fencing and gate is watched by a large elk statue perched atop the building.

- Excerpt from UNESCO document -
When Emmanuel-Philibert, Duke of Savoy, moved his capital to Turin in 1562, he began a vast series of building projects (continued by his successors) to demonstrate the power of the ruling house. This outstanding complex of buildings, designed and embellished by the leading architects and artists of the time, radiates out into the surrounding countryside from the Royal Palace in the 'Command Area' of Turin to include many country residences and hunting lodges.
The Residences of the Royal House of Savoy in and around Turin represent a comprehensive overview of European monumental architecture in the 17th and 18th centuries, using style, dimensions, and space to illustrate in an exceptional way the prevailing doctrine of absolute monarchy in material terms.]]></desc>
